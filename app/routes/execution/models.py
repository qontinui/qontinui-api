"""Pydantic models for execution API requests and responses.

This module defines all request and response models for the execution REST API endpoints.
All models use Pydantic for validation and serialization.

Migrated from qontinui core library (Phase 2: Core Library Cleanup).

NO backward compatibility - clean, modern Python with full type hints.
